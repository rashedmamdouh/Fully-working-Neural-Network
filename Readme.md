# Fully-Working Neural Network from Scratch README

This README provides an overview of the "Fully-Working Neural Network from Scratch" project, including objectives, components, usage instructions, and key considerations.

## 1. Objectives
The main objective of this project is to build a fully-functional neural network from scratch. This includes implementing the core components of a neural network, such as layers, activation functions, loss functions, and optimization algorithms, without relying on deep learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch. The project aims to provide hands-on experience in understanding the inner workings of neural networks.

## 2. Components
To create a fully-working neural network from scratch, the following components need to be implemented:

### 2.1 Neural Network Architecture
- Design the architecture of the neural network, including the number of layers, the number of neurons in each layer, and the activation functions used.

### 2.2 Layers
- Implement different types of layers such as fully connected (dense) layers, convolutional layers (if working on a convolutional neural network), and more, based on the network architecture.

### 2.3 Activation Functions
- Implement activation functions like ReLU, Sigmoid, or Tanh for introducing non-linearity into the network.

### 2.4 Loss Functions
- Implement loss functions such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) for regression tasks or Cross-Entropy Loss for classification tasks.

### 2.5 Optimization Algorithms
- Implement optimization algorithms like Gradient Descent or its variants (e.g., Adam) for updating the network's weights during training.

### 2.6 Forward and Backward Pass
- Implement the forward pass, where input data is passed through the network to make predictions.
- Implement the backward pass (backpropagation), which calculates gradients and updates weights during training.

### 2.7 Training Loop
- Develop a training loop to iteratively train the neural network on a dataset.
- Include features like batch training and early stopping.

## 3. Usage Instructions
To use the fully-working neural network implemented from scratch, follow these steps:

### 3.1 Define the Network Architecture
- Define the neural network's architecture, specifying the number of layers, neurons in each layer, and activation functions.

### 3.2 Create an Instance of the Network
- Instantiate the neural network class, initializing the weights and biases.

### 3.3 Prepare Data
- Prepare your dataset, including preprocessing, splitting into training and testing sets, and loading it into your code.

### 3.4 Training
- Use your training data to train the network. Iterate through epochs and batches, forward and backward pass, and update weights using the chosen optimization algorithm.

### 3.5 Evaluation
- Evaluate the trained network on a separate testing dataset to assess its performance using appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, mean squared error).

### 3.6 Prediction
- Use the trained network to make predictions on new, unseen data.

## 4. Key Considerations
When implementing a neural network from scratch, consider the following:

- Efficiency: Optimize your code for efficiency and speed, especially when handling large datasets.
- Numerical Stability: Be aware of numerical stability issues, especially when calculating gradients.
- Hyperparameters: Experiment with different hyperparameters, such as learning rates and batch sizes, to achieve better performance.
- Regularization: Implement regularization techniques like dropout or L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.
- Debugging: Implement a robust logging and debugging system to track training progress and identify issues.
